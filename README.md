# Enabling-Secure-Internet-Access-via-FortiGate-Firewall-in-a-Simulated-Network
## INTRODUCTION
This project demonstrates the practical application of skills gained during my Fortinet Certified Associate (FCA) training. It simulates a real-world setup of a FortiGate firewall to securely provide internet access to internal LAN devices. The project focuses on key configurations such as interfaces, routing, NAT, and firewall policies to enforce secure and controlled network communication.
## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the skills acquired during my Fortinet Certified Associate cybersecurity training by simulating a real-world configuration of a FortiGate firewall. The goal is to allow and secure internet access for internal LAN devices, showcasing practical knowledge of firewall policies, NAT, and network segmentation.
## Skills Learned
- Comprehensive understanding of FortiGate firewall functionality and architecture.
- Proficiency in configuring and managing FortiGate firewall interfaces, policies, and NAT. 
- Enhanced knowledge of core network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP).
- Strengthened critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity and network troubleshooting.
## Tools Used
- Graphical Network Simulator-3 (gns3).
- firefox broswer ( to configure fortigate GUI).
- Google (for research)
## STEPS 
This are the steps i took in order to me this project possbile ,with images .
### STEP1: Accessing fortigate GUI
In order to connect the GUI in gsn3 ,the firewall as to be to outer network through the "cloud" appliance. In order to make this happen , fortigate had to be connected the cloud  and has to optain ip from the "cloud" appliance , for this to happen fortinet has to be set in dhcp mode. As shown in the image below:
